# Digital Image Processing

This repo contains my attempt at the assignments of the course "EEE F435 - Digital Image Processing". The code has been written in MATLAB.

## Assignment List
1. Read and convert an image into grayscale.
2. Convert an image inro binary by varying the threshold.
3. Convert two images into binary and perform logical operations. Take two matrices and perform arthmatic operations. Generate two binary images and perform logical operations to get a meaningful image.
4. Perform intensity slicing and recombination
5. Obtain Histogram of a given image, perform histogram equalization, and histogram matching with a reference image.
